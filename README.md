In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
- The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive and user friendly experience. 
- According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics such as categories of gender using bike share system,  age categories, start and end stations statistics and trip statistics.

### Files used
1. bikeshare.py
2. chicago.csv
3. new_york_city.csv
4. washington.csv

### Softwares needed:
1. python 3
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. atom text editor

### Installation instructions for the software and firmware
1. Git for windows - for terminal application using Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/
2. Python using Anaconda (latest version for windows)](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution

### Statistics Computed:
The code helps user to explore bike share system services in Chicago, New York City and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, the code output will provide the following information:
